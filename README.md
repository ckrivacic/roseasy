The purpose of this repository will be to help track designs. Basically
I'm thinking PIP, but more generalized and flexible (i.e. let the user
decide what to do at each step, just provide the tools). It will handle
tracking where files came from (order of operations), submitting and
syncing jobs to cluster, etc.

I suppose starting pt will be PIP.

Ideally, you would be able to specify a protocol in a file somewhere and
easily share it with others. You could then run that protocol by going
"despl next" or whatever.
